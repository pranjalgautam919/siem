A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Dashboard is a centralized visual interface designed to provide real-time insights into an organization's security posture. It aggregates, analyzes, and displays security data collected from multiple sources such as firewalls, servers, endpoints, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and applications.

üîç Key Features:
Real-Time Log Monitoring: Continuously captures and displays logs from various systems, highlighting suspicious or malicious activities.

Alert Management Panel: Provides actionable alerts based on correlation rules or threat intelligence feeds, with severity classification.

Search and Filtering: Enables analysts to search logs by IPs, timestamps, or event types, with advanced filters for targeted investigation.

Threat Intelligence Integration: Matches incoming events with known threat indicators (IP/domain blacklists, malware signatures, etc.).

Visual Analytics: Interactive charts and graphs (e.g., pie, bar, radar) showing event types, sources, severities, and geolocation of threats.

User Activity Tracking: Monitors user behavior and detects anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

Incident Response Tools: Enables ticketing/helpdesk support to manage and respond to security incidents.

Authentication & Access Control: Role-based access ensures secure login and restricted views for different user levels (Admin, Analyst, etc.).

ElasticSearch or MongoDB Integration: Scalable and efficient data indexing for fast log querying and analysis.
